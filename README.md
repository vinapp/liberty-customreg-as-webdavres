# liberty-customreg-as-webdavres

About the sample:

Sample contains OSGi app (CustUserRegLibertyFeature.zip) and the Liberty feature (CustUserRegLibertyOSGiApp.zip) that you can import into eclipse and customize the sample.

In case you want to use the feature directly without customizing the you can take other zip that contains the jar and manifest file that you can directly copy the liberty extension folder and the feature is enabled for you and of course you need to add the feature in server.xml of liberty server.
