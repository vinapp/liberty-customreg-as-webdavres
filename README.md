# liberty-customreg-as-webdavres

About the sample:

* Sample contains OSGi Bundle app (CustUserRegLibertyOSGiApp.zip) and the Liberty feature app (CustUserRegLibertyFeature.zip) that you can import into eclipse and customize the sample.

* In case you want to use the feature directly without customizing then you can take other the jar and manifest file and directly copy the liberty extension folder and the feature is enabled for you and ofcourse you need to add the feature entry in server.xml of liberty server.
